Hey there 👋

I’m Mariam, a Computer Science student interested in web development and data-related projects.

I mostly work with JavaScript — building backend APIs with Express.js and frontend applications with Angular.  
I’m also exploring data analysis and AI, and slowly adding projects as I learn.

This is a growing profile where I share projects, experiments, and things I’m currently working on.  
Everything here is built by me, from scratch.
